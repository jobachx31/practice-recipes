        <h3> Description </h3>
        <p>
            A pancake is a thin, flat, circular piece of cooked batter made from milk, flour, and eggs. 

            Pancakes are often rolled up or folded and eaten hot with a sweet or savoury filling inside.
            
            In America, pancakes are usually eaten for breakfast, with butter and maple syrup.
